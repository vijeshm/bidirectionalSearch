Measure of efficiency:
	1 / (time * (actual path/shortest path))
		Say that it is a trivial measure
	Say that time is an important factor - show graph for varying number of nodes
	Say that the ratio (actual path/shortest path) - show graph for varying number of nodes.

1. Behavior on a synthetic Scale-Free Network (BA Model)
	Run the code on the spot and show the demo.

2. Behavior on a Real World Networks
	Run the code on the gnutella network and show the demo.
	Induced subgraph is taken into consideration

Issues involved:
1. Parallelization
	- Syncing Problems
2. One Way Adamic - cycle handling
	Adamic uses the choice of the neighbor with the next highest degree
	but we pick it randomly to reduce the cost of calculation.
		but this may again lead to cycles. in such a case, take 2 hops. this causes a cycle. Now, remove the cycle.
		After taking 2 hops, if it again leads to a cycle, then restart.

3. Performance Optimizations - Flagging technique instead of linear search

Explain the problems and tell how we're gonna solve them.

Show that we've tried parallelizing the code.

Say that we're gonna write a paper on it during this summer. Say that it is a research topic and it never ends.
