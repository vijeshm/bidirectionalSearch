	containing a few nodes that have a very high degree and many with
	low degree. The high connectivity nodes play the important role of
	hubs in communication and networking, a fact that can be exploited
	when designing efficient search algorithms. We introduce a number
	of local search strategies that utilize high degree nodes in power-law
	graphs and that have costs scaling sublinearly with the size of the
	graph. We also demonstrate the utility of these strategies on the
	{GNUTELLA} peer-to-peer network.},

  abstract = {{The study of human navigation has long been dominated by the so-called
	stage theory, i.e. the notion that there are three distinct types
	of spatial knowledge (landmark, route, and survey knowledge), that
	are acquired sequentially during spatial learning and development.
	Based on the results of a route learning experiment in a driving
	simulator, an alternative to the stage theory is proposed. The authors
	suggest that subjects follow either a visually dominated or a spatially
	dominated strategy to solve a route-learning prob- lem. In the visually
	dominated strategy, subjects base their wayfinding decisions on visually
	recognizing decision points along a route; the decision points are
	not integrated into any kind of survey representation. In the spatially
	dominated strategy, on the other hand, subjects represent the environment
	as a survey map right from the start; that is, they do not pass through
	a landmark or route stage. These strategies may be sub- served by
	different cortical areas recently characterized in neurophysiological
	studies of animals solving maze problems.}},

  abstract = {{Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting
	objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological
	organisms and human society1, 2, 3. One crucial step when studying
	the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities4,
	5: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits
	such as protein complexes6, 7 or social spheres8, 9, 10. Communities
	in networks often overlap9, 10 such that nodes simultaneously belong
	to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess
	hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped
	into a hierarchical structure11, 12, 13. However, the fact that many
	real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each
	and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence
	that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships
	between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups
	of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach
	successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of
	overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing
	literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities
	naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization.
	We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major
	biological networks such as protein–protein interaction6, 7, 14 and
	metabolic networks11, 15, 16, and show that a large social network10,
	17, 18 contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning
	inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap.
	Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building
	blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks
	to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.}},

	that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by

	the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world

  abstract = {{Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against
	errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and
	reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions,
	an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying
	metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising
	degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction,
	local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying
	ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex
	systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional
	web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that
	error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed
	only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free
	networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social
	networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected
	degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being
	unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error
	tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely
	vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a
	few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity).
	Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties
	of communication networks}},

  abstract = {{Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these
	measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic
	flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic
	paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network
	only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out
	a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation,
	namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics,
	paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial
	replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched
	to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations
	are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the
	differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements
	such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving
	traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality
	measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes
	they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow
	processes they get the ” wrong” answer. It is noted that the most
	commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of
	the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this
	paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected
	values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency
	of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that
	this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.}},

  abstract = {The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis,
	and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper
	develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All
	measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure
	of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal
	involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed,
	and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type
	of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk
	assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization
	with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization.
	At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's
	involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network.
	Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion
	to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability
	of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the
	one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by
	a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all
	nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in
	turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive
	subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with
	the cohesive subgroup structure of a network.},

  abstract = {Current methods for the detection of contagious outbreaks give contemporaneous
	information about the course of an epidemic at best. It is known
	that individuals near the center of a social network are likely to
	be infected sooner during the course of an outbreak, on average,
	than those at the periphery. Unfortunately, mapping a whole network
	to identify central individuals who might be monitored for infection
	is typically very difficult. We propose an alternative strategy that
	does not require ascertainment of global network structure, namely,
	simply monitoring the friends of randomly selected individuals. Such
	individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether such
	a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a
	flu outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students
	who were either members of a group of randomly chosen individuals
	or a group of their friends. Based on clinical diagnoses, the progression
	of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 13.9 days (95\% {C.I}.
	9.9\^{a}€ ” 16.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e.,
	the population as a whole). The friend group also showed a significant
	lead time ( p <0.05) on day 16 of the epidemic, a full 46 days before
	the peak in daily incidence in the population as a whole. This sensor
	method could provide significant additional time to react to epidemics
	in small or large populations under surveillance. The amount of lead
	time will depend on features of the outbreak and the network at hand.
	The method could in principle be generalized to other biological,

  abstract = {{Background The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially
	over the past 30 years. We performed a quantitative analysis of the
	nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a
	possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. Methods We
	evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people
	assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart
	Study. The body-mass index was available for all subjects. We used
	longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in
	one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends,
	siblings, spouse, and neighbors. Results Discernible clusters of
	obese persons (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by
	the square of the height in meters], [≥]30) were present in the network
	at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of
	separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable
	to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A
	person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57\% (95\% confidence
	interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese
	in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling
	became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased
	by 40\% (95\% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood
	that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37\% (95\%
	CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in the
	immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively
	greater influence on each other than those of the opposite sex. The
	spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of obesity
	in the network. Conclusions Network phenomena appear to be relevant
	to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears
	to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for

  abstract = {Background The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over
	the past 30 years. We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature
	and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible
	factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. Methods We evaluated
	a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed
	repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study.
	The body-mass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal
	statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was
	associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse,
	and neighbors. Results Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass
	index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height
	in meters], [≥]30) were present in the network at all time points,
	and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters
	did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation
	of social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming
	obese increased by 57\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 6 to 123)
	if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among
	pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance
	that the other would become obese increased by 40\% (95\% {CI}, 21
	to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other
	spouse would become obese increased by 37\% (95\% {CI}, 7 to 73).
	These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic
	location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence
	on each other than those of the opposite sex. The spread of smoking
	cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network.
	Conclusions Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic
	and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through
	social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public
	health interventions. {10.1056/NEJMsa066082}},

  abstract = {Finding information in a peer-to-peer system currently requires either
	a costly and vulnerable central index, or ooding the network with
	queries. In this paper we introduce the concept of Routing Indices
	({RIs}), which allow nodes to forward queries to neighbors that are
	more likely to have answers. If a node cannot answer a query, it
	forwards the query to a subset of its neighbors, based on its local
	{RI}, rather than by selecting neighbors at random or by ooding the
	network by forwarding the query to all neighbors. We present three
	{RI} schemes: the compound, the hop-count, and the exponential routing
	indices. We evaluate their performance via simulations, and nd that
	{RIs} can improve performance by one or two orders of magnitude vs.
	a ooding-based system, and by up to 100 \% vs. a random forwarding
	system. We also discuss the tradeo s between the di erent {RIschemes}
	and highlight the e ects of key design variables on system performance.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of labeling the nodes of a graph in a way
	that will allow one to compute the distance between any two nodes
	directly from their labels (without using any additional information).
	Our main interest is in the minimal length of labels needed in different
	cases. We obtain upper and lower bounds for several interesting families
	of graphs. In particular, our main results are the following. For
	general graphs, we show that the length needed is Θ(n). For trees,
	we show that the length needed is Θ(log2n). For planar graphs, we
	show an upper bound of Image and a lower bound of Ω(n1/3). For bounded
	degree graphs, we show a lower bound of Image . The upper bounds
	for planar graphs and for trees follow by a more general upper bound
	for graphs with a r(n)-separator. The two lower bounds, however,
	are obtained by two different arguments that may be interesting in
	their own right. We also show some lower bounds on the length of
	the labels, even if it is only required that distances be approximated
	to a multiplicative factor s. For example, we show that for general
	graphs the required length is Ω(n) for every s<3. We also consider
	the problem of the time complexity of the distance function once
	the labels are computed. We show that there are graphs with optimal
	labels of length 3logn, such that if we use any labels with fewer
	than n bits per label, computing the distance function requires exponential
	time. A similar result is obtained for planar and bounded degree
	graphs.},

  abstract = {{Spatial behavior in humans and animals includes a wide variety of
	behavioral competences and makes use of a large number of sensory
	cues. Here we studied the ability of human subjects to search locations,
	to nd shortcuts and novel paths, to estimate distances between remembered
	places, and to draw sketch maps of the explored environment; these
	competences are related to goal-independent memory of space, or cognitive
	maps. Information on spatial relations was restricted to two types:
	a visual motion sequence generated by simulated move- ments in a
	virtual maze and the subject's own movement decisions de ning the
	path through the maze. Visual informa- tion was local (i.e., no global
	landmarks or compass informa- tion was provided). Other position
	and movement information (vestibular or proprioceptive) was excluded.
	The amount of visual information provided was varied over four experimental
	conditions. The results indicate that human subjects are able to
	learn a virtual maze from sequences of local views and movements.
	The information acquired is local, consisting of recognized positions
	and movement decisions associated to them. Although simple associations
	of this type can be shown to be present in some subjects, more complete
	con gurational knowledge is acquired as well. The results are discussed
	in a view-based framework of navigation and the representation of
	spatial knowledge by means of a view graph.}},

	that evolutionary biology is a crucial basic science for medicine.
	In addition to looking at established evolutionary methods and topics,
	such as population genetics and pathogen evolution, we highlight
	questions about why natural selection leaves bodies vulnerable to

	competency in evolutionary biology. Premedical students need evolution
	courses, possibly ones that emphasize medically relevant aspects.
	In medical school, evolutionary biology should be taught as one of
	the basic medical sciences. This will require a course that reviews
	basic principles and specific medical applications, followed by an

	Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper

	by using data drawn from a number of databases, including {MEDLINE}
	(biomedical research), the Los Alamos {e-Print} Archive (physics),

	networks form ” small worlds,” in which randomly chosen pairs of
	scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate
	acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of
	numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of
	clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences
	in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.},

	Several types of algorithms exist for revealing the community structure

	is not implemented in the algorithms, leading to an intrinsic difficulty
	in the interpretation of the results without any additional nontopological
	information. In this article we deal with this problem by showing

	in the existing algorithms. In this way the algorithms for the identification
	of the community structure become fully self-contained. Furthermore,
	we propose a local algorithm to detect communities which outperforms
	the existing algorithms with respect to computational cost, keeping
	the same level of reliability. The algorithm is tested on artificial
	and real-world graphs. In particular, we show how the algorithm applies
	to a network of scientific collaborations, which, for its size, cannot

	mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus)}},
  journal = {BMC Ecology},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {3+},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:During their movements in the wild, wood mice (Apodemus
	sylvaticus) distribute small objects, such as leaves or twigs, which
	are often visually conspicuous. Our experiments demonstrate that
	these marks serve as points of reference during exploration. Way-marking,
	as we call it, may diminish the likelihood of losing an "interesting"
	location, perhaps following disturbance by, for example, a predator
	or conspecific. Way-marks, being readily portable, may be a less
	confusing method of marking ephemeral sites than scent marks. They
	may also be a safer option for local navigation insofar as scent
	marks can easily be detected by a predator.RESULTS:In an experiment,
	conspicuous natural candidate way-marks were removed from a simple
	arena and wood mice were given white plastic discs instead. The wood
	mice picked up these discs and re-distributed them about their arena;
	as the mice moved, they repeatedly re-positioned the discs and usually
	spent a considerable time near recently repositioned discs. Analysis
	revealed a statistically significant association between the location
	of places in which the mice had positioned way-marks and the subsequent
	pattern of their movements. In a separate analysis, based on the
	context in which each behaviour occurred, we used the components
	and sequences of wood mouse behaviour to deduce the motivation behind
	each activity. One set of behaviour patterns, the elements of which
	were closely linked by the high transition probabilities amongst
	them, were interpreted as linked elements of exploration; whenever
	the mice transported a disc it was in association with these exploratory
	behaviours. This evidence that transporting discs is set in the motivational
	context of exploratory behaviour supports the conclusion that way-marking
	is part of the wood mouse's system of spatial orientation.CONCLUSION:We
	conclude that way-marking - a behaviour not previously described
	in mammals other than humans - serves solely as an aid to spatial
	navigation during exploration.}},

  month = mar,
  abstract = {{t the heart of the universe is a steady, insistent beat, the sound
	of cycles in sync. Along the tidal rivers of Malaysia, thousands
	of fireflies congregate and flash in unison; the moon spins in perfect
	resonance with its orbit around the earth; our hearts depend on the
	synchronous firing of ten thousand pacemaker cells. While the forces
	that synchronize the flashing of fireflies may seem to have nothing
	to do with our heart cells, there is in fact a deep connection. Synchrony
	is a science in its infancy, and Strogatz is a pioneer in this new
	frontier in which mathematicians and physicists attempt to pinpoint
	just how spontaneous order emerges from chaos. From underground caves
	in Texas where a French scientist spent six months alone tracking
	his sleep-wake cycle, to the home of a Dutch physicist who in 1665
	discovered two of his pendulum clocks swinging in perfect time, this
	fascinating book spans disciplines, continents, and centuries. Engagingly
	written for readers of books such as Chaos and The Elegant Universe,
	Sync is a tour-de-force of nonfiction writing.}},

  month = feb,
  abstract = {{You may be only six degrees away from Kevin Bacon, but would he let
	you borrow his car? It depends on the structures within the network
	that links you. When the power goes out, when we find that a stranger
	knows someone we know, when dot-com stocks soar in price, networks
	are evident. In <I>Six Degrees</I>, sociologist Duncan Watts examines
	networks like these: what they are, how they're being studied, and
	what we can use them for. To illustrate the often complicated mathematics
	that describe such structures, Watts uses plenty of examples from
	life, without which this book would quickly move beyond a general
	science readership. Small chapters make each thought-provoking conclusion
	easy to swallow, though some are hard to digest. For instance, in
	a short bit on "coercive externalities," Watts sums up sociological
	research showing that: <p> <blockquote>"Conversations concerning
	politics displayed a consistent pattern .... On election day, the
	strongest predictor of electoral success was not which party an individual
	privately supported but which party he or she expected would win."</blockquote>
	</p> <I>Six Degrees</I> attempts to help readers understand the new
	and exciting field of networks and complexity. While considerably
	more demanding than a general book like <I>The Tipping Point</I>,
	it offers readers a snapshot of a riveting moment in science, when
	understanding things like disease epidemics and the stock market
	seems almost within our reach. <I>--Therese Littleton</I>} {The pioneering
	young scientist whose work on the structure of small worlds has triggered
	an avalanche of interest in networks. In this remarkable book, Duncan
	Watts, one of the principal architects of network theory, sets out
	to explain the innovative research that he and other scientists are
	spearheading to create a blueprint of our connected planet. Whether
	they bind computers, economies, or terrorist organizations, networks
	are everywhere in the real world, yet only recently have scientists
	attempted to explain their mysterious workings. <P>From epidemics
	of disease to outbreaks of market madness, from people searching
	for information to firms surviving crisis and change, from the structure
	of personal relationships to the technological and social choices
	of entire societies, Watts weaves together a network of discoveries
	across an array of disciplines to tell the story of an explosive
	new field of knowledge, the people who are building it, and his own
	peculiar path in forging this new science. 24 b/w illustrations.}},

	and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection
	topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely
	random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie
	somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models
	of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular
	networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We
	find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices,
	yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We
	call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world
	phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15).
	The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power
	grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of
	film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical
	systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation
